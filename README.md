Inofficial LaTeX template with a cover inspired by the new TUM Corporate Design adapted for the University of Bamberg - i.e. minimalistic typography with sans-serif Helvetica font.
The default serif font for the content part is Palatino, with a slightly wider column width than the vanilla LaTeX book class. For theses, seminars, homeworks etc. at the University of Bamberg.

In addition to the original version by [Michael Grupp](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/TTT "Link to original repository") this modified version includes the University of Bamberg logos and colors (titlepage font), the option to use a beautifully formatted poem page, and more relevant LaTeX examples.
